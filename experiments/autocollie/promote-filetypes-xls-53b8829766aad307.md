1 DEPLOYED-TOLERANCE regression(s) (vs currently-deployed bundle /home/t/.local/share/litmus/models/azoth) — THIS IS WHAT BLOCKS THE DEPLOY:
  - xls: L4 hostile ENSEMBLE recall dropped 2.80pp (93.19% → 90.39%; tolerance 1.70pp; deployed 95% CI lower = 92.42%)

1 LOW-WATER-MARK regression(s) (pinned reference: out/models/azoth_low_water_mark/route_policy_eval_oof.json):
  - xls: L4 hostile ENSEMBLE recall dropped 2.06pp BELOW LOW-WATER-MARK (92.44% → 90.39%; LWM tolerance 0.90pp)

compared 75 filetypes (mal≥1, ben≥1); 3 below threshold and skipped.

blocked by: deployed-tolerance gate (1 filetype(s) regressed vs deployed beyond the 1.70pp tolerance; see list above for the actual drops), low-water-mark gate (1 filetype(s) below LWM beyond the 0.90pp tolerance vs out/models/azoth_low_water_mark/route_policy_eval_oof.json)

If this regression is intentional, set AZOTH_ALLOW_REGRESSION=1 and re-run (or pass --net-improvement-fallback for shared-route promotes to address the deployed-tolerance gate only — the LWM gate is unconditional and AZOTH_ALLOW_REGRESSION is the only override for it).
